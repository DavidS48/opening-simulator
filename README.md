# opening-simulator

This is a small Python project for exploring the typical opening repertoire of online chess players by creating simulated games fragments.

A player simulated using weighted random draws from the Lichess database can be contrasted with one that consistently plays the top move from Lichess' "masters" database - this gives an interesting perspective into how quickly a typical online player will go "out of book".
